<h1 align="center">Al-Akeel Food Ordering Platform</h1>

## **Introduction**

Al-Akeel Company has developed an online order management platform over the past 15 Years. That platform generally allows users to make online orders to a specific restaurant from a registered restaurant list. It also tracks and delivers such orders from the restaurant's locations to the customer. The platform serves clients from either a dedicated mobile application, web app or assisted from customer service over the phone. The platform allows restaurant staff to manage their restaurants specific orders. The platform integrates with Bank Misr as a payment gateway to full-fill online payments for orders. The platform integrates with Aramex shipment company to manage the delivery of orders. Recently the company started to face a set of issues mainly reliability issues where some times the platform reported to be down. Suffers from slow responses. They also faced a huge challenge when they needed to support mobile payment as well as support Al-Akeel specific shipment fleet to work side by side with the existing Aramex shipment.
